# Computer Monitoring Cloud Native Application

" Developed a cloud-native resource monitoring application using Python and Flask 
to track system metrics like CPU, memory, and disk usage via psutil. 

The app was containerized using Docker, with Docker files created to build images. 
Deployed the application on Kubernetes, leveraging Amazon EKS for cluster management. 

Implemented Python scripts to automate the creation of ECR repositories using 
Boto3, and pushed Docker images to ECR. Managed Kubernetes deployments and 
services, ensuring scalability and reliability for cloud-based infrastructure 
monitoring."
